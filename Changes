Revision history for Perl extension CSS::SAC.

0.03  Mon Apr 23 16:44:16 2001
	- switched all to Class::ArrayObjects (which used to be CSS::SAC::Helpers::ArrayObjects)
	- provide both standard and perlified names for methods
	- added lots of documentation (can still be improved, suggestions
	welcome)
	- removed SACPrinter and replaced it with CSS::SAC::Writer, more
	flexible
	- fixed a number of small bugs here and there
	- fixed a serious bug whereby it was possible to tokenize two
	selectors in a row without a combinator (it now is seen as a fatal
	error but perhaps it should just flag an error (and keep on
	parsing)
	- the parser was creating negative conditions, something that I
	don't think really exists in the spec. It should have been
	creating negative selectors, which it now does.

0.02-i  04/03/2001  alpha mark II
	- added SelectorLists
	- started to add some things to make the interface closer to the
	spec for those who prefer that, while maintaining the perlishness
	for the others

0.01-i  04/03/2001 alpha mark I
	- initial tests and limited public release
	- refoundation of the entire CSS::Parser into CSS::SAC

before  22/10/1999 and previously
	- the ugly and broken CSS::Parser (now obsolete)
